You will be asked to mimic a series of target hand movements, which will be demonstrated on videos in a window.  Memorize the posture and speed of the target hand movements. 

A virtual box tells you the proper location where your hand and head should be.  Keep your left hand with palm facing down and fingers spread at the beginning of trial.

Watch a red cross on or alongside your virtual hand for a while.  The cross will be replaced by a red square, during which you will perform hand movements to make the memorized posture.  A beep tone will remind you when to start moving.  Mimic the memorized posture as exactly as possible.
