You will be asked to judge the duration of a red square appearing at different location. Using a joystick and button of the controller in your right hand, you can choose how long you felt the red square was presented (1000-3000 ms). After your answer, you will see the feedback. Please accurately estimate the duration as much as possible. Trials will be repeated until your accuracy of duration estimation reaches sufficiently high level.
