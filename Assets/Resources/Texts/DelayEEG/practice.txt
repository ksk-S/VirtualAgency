In this practice session, you will practice hand movements used in the main experiment. Please always focus on your left hand and execute EVERY movement by keeping your palm up. After the movement practice you will receive tactile and visual-tactile stimulations three times each. The tactile one will be provided by a very light electric stimulation on your wrist. The visual-tactile one will consist of a virtual finger touching the lower part of your hand in addition to the electric stimulation.
Press it as soon as you ready to start the experiment.
