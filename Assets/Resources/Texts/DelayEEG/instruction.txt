In the following study you will be asked to freely move your hand or respond to guidelines that will be presented in the virtual world. Please always focus on your left hand and execute EVERY movement by keeping your palm up. After the movement phase, you will receive a certain number of visual/tactile stimulations. The visual one will consist of a virtual finger touching  the lower part of your hand. The tactile one will be provided by a very light electric stimulation on your wrist. At the end of every block you will be asked to rate the level of experienced ownership of your own hand on a continuous scale. Ratings can be provided by rotating a dial close to your right-hand. Press down a dial to initiate the start of every block. 
Press it as soon as you ready to start the experiment.
