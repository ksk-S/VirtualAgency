You will be asked to mimic a series of target hand movements, which will be demonstrated on videos in a window.  Memorize the posture and speed of the target hand movements. 

NOTICE: in case you see a large blue 'X' on the window, do NOT move your left hand throughout the trial.

A virtual box tells you the proper location where your hand and head should be.  Keep your left hand with palm facing down and fingers spread at the beginning of trial.

Watch a red cross near either your virtual hand or the otherâ€™s virtual hand.  After the cross disappeared, a red square will be superimposed onto the hand, during which you will perform the memorized movements.  Mimic the memorized movements as exactly as possible.
