Mimic a series of target hand movements, which will be demonstrated on a photo, as exactly as possible.  In case you see a large blue 'X' on the demo photo, do NOT move your left hand throughout the trial.

Ensure your palm down and fingers spread at the beginning of trial.  Immediately after a red cross is replaced by a red frame, make the target posture and keep the posture until the red frame disappears.  Or, in the case of the blue X, keep your hand still. 

Finally, judge the duration of the red frame.  At the end of each 5 trials, answer to 2 questions: “How much did you feel you control VR hand?” and “How much did you feel as if the VR hand was part of your body?” using 7-point scale from “Strongly disagree” to “Neither” to “Strongly agree.” 

You can take a break between blocks on request.
