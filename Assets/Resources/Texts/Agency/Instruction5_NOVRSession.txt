Press the red button whenever you feel like it. Sometimes you will notice the button is pressed ‘all by itself’. When this happens, you do not need to move your hand. Please estimate the time interval between the button press and the subsequent tone. IMPORTANT: Remember to wait for a moment before each attempt!
